- [x] Two layers: "land" (outside) and adm(inside, hover possible, action on hover)
- [x] add "Context": countries
- [-] Add labels (from geojson properties) : give choice to select font + marker
- [ ] "Save current geo params" -> localstorage. If defined, to moving on import new file
- [x] Support import geojson
- [x] Create tooltips on hover: have a builder to chose properties on geometries
- [ ] Default themes (pirate map style, brand style...)
- [-] Add possibility to change background image (noise for now)
- [x] Import geojson instead of topojson
- [x] Draw on canvas on move, using simplified geometries
- [ ] Export with a level of precision
- [-] Export a JS file defining a class, to call on an element
- [x] Allow placing points (choosing from a set of shapes)
    - [x] Make the shape resizable / stylable with inline-style-editor (right click -> edit size + edit style)
- [x] Allow associating labels to those points
- [x] Allow customization of paths strokes
- [ ] Allow adding bubbles (projected or not)
    - [ ] Add "create bubble" on right click -> display radius, editable later on with inline-style-editor
    - [ ] Create tooltip for the bubbles (one for each bubble) 
- [x] Allow customizing the contour (no contour, size, border-type, color...)
- [x] Fix different sizes of container for SVG / canvas
- [x] Give choice of viewBox vs width/height
- [x] If viewBox, always fill container, and get dynamic size for drawing with canvas
- [x] If width/height, give control over width/height
- [x] Fix change sea color not working
- [ ] Add spinner on loading (geosjon / font)
- [ ] Fix dragging created paths
- [ ] Display labels using projection (how?)
- [ ] Add credits to:
    - geoboundaries
    - greensock
    - d3
    - github
    - "tilting the satellite observable"
- [ ] Option to push to front on hover to avoid surrounding boundaries of top of hovered ( add js to export ?)
- [x] Find a way to retain inline styles on redraw  
- [x] Define <style> in <defs> in SVG directly  
- [ ] Allow for ordering <land> div after/before countries/ADM1. If after, remove <SourceGraphic> from merge filter, otherwise retain it (for stroke)
- [x] Wrap "land" inside an inline <image> tag, inside a separate <svg> for FF performance (and maybe other browsers?)
    - MUCH worse performance on chrome. Tried:
        - Move svg containing <image> on the outside: same
        - Same principle, using <img> tag: same
    - Solution: will-change: opacity + <image>
 - [ ] Instructions: how to tilt / rotate / zoom / drag
 - [ ] Change zoom sensibility according to FOV
