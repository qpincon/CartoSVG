- [x] Two layers: "land" (outside) and adm(inside, hover possible, action on hover)
- [x] add "Context": countries
- [-] Add labels (from geojson properties) : give choice to select font + marker
- [x] "Save current geo params" -> localstorage. If defined, to moving on import new file

- [x] Allow associating labels to those points
- [x] Allow customization of paths strokes
- [ ] Allow adding bubbles (projected or not)
    - [ ] Add "create bubble" on right click -> display radius, editable later on with inline-style-editor
    - [ ] Create tooltip for the bubbles (one for each bubble) 
- [x] Allow customizing the contour (no contour, size, border-type, color...)
- [x] Fix different sizes of container for SVG / canvas
- [x] Give choice of viewBox vs width/height
- [x] If viewBox, always fill container, and get dynamic size for drawing with canvas

- [x] Fix change sea color not working
- [ ] Add spinner on loading (geosjon / font)
- [x] Fix dragging created paths
- [ ] Display labels using projection (how?)
- [x] Add credits to:
    - geoboundaries
    - d3
    - github
    - "tilting the satellite observable"
- [x] Option to push to front on hover to avoid surrounding boundaries of top of hovered ( add js to export ?) => always here, but replace on leave
- [x] Find a way to retain inline styles on redraw  
- [x] Define <style> in <defs> in SVG directly  
- [x] Allow for ordering <land> div after/before countries/ADM1. If after, remove <SourceGraphic> from merge filter, otherwise retain it (for stroke)
- [x] Wrap "land" inside an inline <image> tag, inside a separate <svg> for FF performance (and maybe other browsers?)
    - MUCH worse performance on chrome. Tried:
        - Move svg containing <image> on the outside: same
        - Same principle, using <img> tag: same
    - Solution: will-change: opacity + <image>
- [x] Instructions: how to tilt / rotate / zoom / drag
- [x] Change zoom sensibility according to FOV
- [x] Animate object along path
- [x] Add validation on imported data (alpha-3 / shapeName)
- [x] Add conversion of final CSS rgb(x y z) => #hex
- [x] Format tooltip when containing decimal values => determine formatter automatically
    - [x] Allow to change format locale
- [-] Choice to remove imported fonts -> export only used fonts

- [x] Export button => popup modal to select
    - [x] No redraw on resize
    - [x] Choice between "font(s) will be included in final file" & "best between embed font / transform text to paths"
- [x] SEO: title + meta tag + raw html for FAQ
- [x] Redesign layout: accordions on right, data / colors / legend on left
- [x] Add line at the end of path (<marker>)
- [x] Delete paths on right click in menu
- [ ] Sitemap
- [x] Allow change fill color for land when base layer
- [ ] README github: explain how optimizations work
- [x] Add example(s)
- [x] Change default filter 2 
- [x] Make more fine-tuning altitude/FOV more intuitive
- [x] Allow minification of JS
- [-] Implement Undo / Redo on points / labels moving 
- [x] Allow more projections
- [x] Add categorical colors by hand
- [x] Formatting language: chose for legend + tooltip
- [ ] Store deleted elements. Button to reset deleted ?
- [x] Disable double-click zoom
- [x] Legend: style not applied on template
- [x] Legend: color width/height not reported immediatly
- [x] Tooltip check/uncheck: style not applied to template
- [x] Altitude bounds not correct when satellite directly used
- [x] Allow for undefined values in quantil/ze, with a checkbox appearing if there are undefined values
- [-] Legend can go off-canvas when resizing -> Not a big deal
- [x] On small canvas, there seems to be off-canvas drawings
- [x] Export as raster no working when legend is present
- [x] Dynamic bounds for border radius depending on max of width/height
- [ ] inline style editor: no css selection by attribute with [id=]
- [x] geoclip to accomodate border-radius ? at least use masking
- [x] modifications on stroke of country not exported when saving
- [x] Allow for multi-line labels
- [x] Inline style editor: give name to other elements. Add parent <text> element for <tspan>
- [x] Only include code for tooltip when one tooltip included
- [x] Delay optimizing content of <image> at export time (for performance)
