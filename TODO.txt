- Two layers: "land" (outside) and adm(inside, hover possible, action on hover)
- add "Context": countries
- Add labels (from geojson properties) : give choice to select font + marker
- "Save current geo params" -> localstorage. If defined, to moving on import new file
- Support import geojson
- Create tooltips on hover: have a builder to chose properties on geometries
- Export all into a custom format, and create a svelte component that can rebuild the map (with all it contains) based on this format
- Style defaults (masae style, pirate map style, ...)
- Add clip path (rectangle, circle...)
- Add possibility to change background image (noise for now)
- Import geojson instead of topojson
- Draw on canvas on move, using simplified geometries
- Export with a level of precision
